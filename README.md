# house_price_prediction
A regression model based on the Ames Housing Dataset to predict house prices for interested buyers and sellers. Since market value of a house is more than its square footage and location, we would like to find out all features that add value to a house. The success of the model is evaluated on unseen data provided on Kaggle.
